## Hi — I'm Harir Hammadi 👋

> Software engineer focused on full‑stack web and backend development. I graduated in June 2025 with a Bachelor of Computing (Co-op) in Software Engineering from the University of Guelph. I build reliable backend services, responsive frontends, and full‑stack applications using Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript and SQL.
